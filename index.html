  <h4><em>A private foundation supporting Canadian charities</em></h4>
  <h4>The Rubin & So Foundation was established in 2020 to promote the well-being of the environment and humanity. With roots in healthcare, technology and entrepreneurship, the founders believe that through higher education and advances in science,
    we will find solutions that enable us all to lead safe, healthy and productive lives in balance with the natural environment. The foundation partners with Canadian-registered charities that use innovative and effective ways to solve challenges
    related to eliminating poverty, improving healthcare, accessing education and supporting environmental protection through research, awareness and advocacy.
